# CarSpeedCalculator
This is my first app with interface developed in python.

You can calculate speed of your car on every gear what you need. 
You need to input:
- Engine rpm
- Tyre parametres
- Main gear ratio
- Gearbox ratio (minimum 1)

You can calculate conditions for target car's speed and save result configurations.
